This is still a work in progress. As of April 21, 2022, focus is primarily on porting the entire project to Dolphin. Since it handles texture loading differently than PCSX2, it is quite a process. Dolphin builds of this project will be released incrementally as progress is made so check back often. When the project is finally up to par with the PCSX2 version, I will upload the 1.9 (latest version of PCSX2 version) version of the Dolphin port. From then on, both versions will be worked on simulatenously, ensuring parity between the two versions.

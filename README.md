A project attempting to redraw/upscale every texture in Mortal Kombat: Deception, for the [PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net/) and [Dolphin*](https://dolphin-emu.org/) emulators.

This includes
- All UI elements
- Arena textures
- Character textures
- Fonts
- All game modes including Kombat, Konquest, and Puzzle Kombat

This is still a work in progress. As of April 21, 2022 cus is primarily on porting the entire project to Dolphin. Since it handles texture loading differently than PCSX2, it is quite a process. Dolphin builds of this project will be released incrementally as progress is made so check back often. When the project is finally up to par with the PCSX2 version, I will upload the 1.9 (latest version of PCSX2 version) version of the Dolphin port. From then on, both versions will be worked on simulatenously, ensuring parity between the two versions.

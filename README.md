# vStar925's MKDeception Texture Pack Kollection
A project attempting to redraw/upscale every texture in Mortal Kombat: Deception, for PCSX2 and Dolphin.

This includes all UI elements, characters, character art, text, arena textures, and the entirety of Konquest mode.

*New redrawn Finish Her font (Note this screenshot also includes an overhauled healthbar/UI. I have since scrapped this idea and this is no longer available by default*

*Mostly final UI, with upscaled Sky Temple textures. Since 1.6, button prompts have been replaced with those of Xbox One. This is optional and can be reverted.*

*Upscaled fonts and up close look at the new redrawn blood texture. I believe this is the latest version of that texture so this is how it appears in-game.*

*Before and after comparison of one of the arenas in the game. New lava textures and floor textures.*

This is still a work in progress. As of April 21, focus is primarily on porting the entire project to Dolphin. Since it handles texture loading differently than PCSX2, it is quite a process. Dolphin builds of this project will be released incrementally as progress is made so check back often. When the project is finally up to par with the PCSX2 version, I will upload the 1.9 (latest version of PCSX2 version) version of the Dolphin port. From then on, both versions will be worked on simulatenously, ensuring parity between the two versions.
